    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is how to make a great pesto pasta that's slick with pesto sauce without adding tons and tons of oil which makes it overly oily. The secret is using the pasta cooking water - it emulsifies with the oil in the pesto which makes it cling to every strand of pasta. A technique used in every Italian household! Make this with homemade pesto for the best flavour.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quantity homemade pesto </li>
            <li>300 - 350 g / 10 - 12 oz pasta of choice</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup pasta cooking water</li>
            <li>Parmesan, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to the boil with the salt.</li>
            <li>Add pasta and cook for the length of time per the packet.</li>
            <li>Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of of the pasta cooking water.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta in a colander, leave it for a minute.</li>
            <li>Transfer pasta to a bowl (do not use pasta cooking pot, too hot).</li>
            <li>Add pesto and 1/4 cup of pasta water. Toss to coat pasta in pesto, adding more water if required to make pasta silky and saucy, rather than dry and sticky.</li>
            <li>Taste, add more salt and pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with fresh parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
